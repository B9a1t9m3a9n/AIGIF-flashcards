# AI Animation Generator - Project Documentation

## Overview
Professional animation generator application that creates high-quality animated visuals from text prompts using AI models via Replicate API. Features advanced Bayesian inference learning system with user feedback ratings and multiple video generation models.

**Current Status:** Major upgrade complete with benchmark-leading models: Hailuo 2 (#2 globally), Wan 2.2 (VBench #1), and Google Veo 3 (state-of-the-art + audio generation) - all superior to OpenAI Sora quality.

## Recent Changes (Latest First)

### August 2025 - Superior Model Integration
- ✅ **MAJOR UPGRADE**: Replaced ZeroScope V2 XL with benchmark-leading models
